# Django Job Board API
    A RESTful API built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF) for a simple job board application. Users can register as employers or job seekers, post jobs, manage skills, and apply to jobs. Authentication is JWT-based using Simple JWT for token management.

## Features

    User Roles: Employers (post jobs) and Seekers (apply to jobs with skills).
    Custom User Model: Uses email as the username, with role-based validation (e.g., employers can't have skills).
    Models:

    CustomUser: Core user with profile details.
    Profile: One-to-one extension of user (note: currently empty in provided code; extend as needed).
    Skill: Reusable skills for seekers and jobs.
    Job: Posted by employers, with skills, location, and salary.
    Application: Links seekers to jobs.

    API Endpoints: Managed via DRF ViewSets for CRUD operations on Users, Jobs, Skills, and Applications. Additional endpoints for authentication and profile management.
    Authentication: JWT-based (access and refresh tokens). Protected endpoints require Authorization: Bearer <access_token> header.
    Permissions: Assume role-based checks in views (e.g., only employers can create jobs; implement in ViewSets permissions).

## Project Structure

    - apps/users/models.py: Defines CustomUser, Role, and related logic.
    - apps/users/views.py: Likely contains UserViewSet, CustomTokenObtainPairView (custom login), ProfileView.
    - apps/job_application/models.py: Defines Skill, Job, Application, and Profile.
    - apps/job_application/views.py: ViewSets for Jobs, Skills, Applications (e.g., JobViewsets, SkillViewSets, ApplicationViewSets).
    - apps/users/urls.py: Handles user-related routes (registration, login, profile).
    - apps/job_application/urls.py: Handles job-related routes.
    Mount apps in project urls.py, e.g.:
